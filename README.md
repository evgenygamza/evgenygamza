 *2021 sep — 2022 mar*
*position:* QA Engineer
- *Work with technical requirements:* analysis of documentation, search for gray areas and inaccuracies. *Test analysis:* decomposition techniques, drawing [mindmaps](https://drive.google.com/file/d/13kwm2PoHyElWTlQVg6hBp9nPXu2wscqk/view?usp=sharing) for the product and [flowcharts](https://drive.google.com/file/d/1UQfErO6hzyhTBvK14XIQErt4Oq4lrln-/view?usp=sharing).*Test design:* assembling test suites and checklists using equivalence partition and boundary values. Optimization with decision tables. Creating test cases and testing them myself.

*Web testing:* a training version of Yandex.maps (with carsharing and air taxi) was used as a working project. My tasks included testing the layout of the service and its sections, part of the finished functionality and part of the functionality implemented only on the frontend. In the latter case I used Charles to emulate responses from the backend. Adaptive layout I tested with devtools and mobile browser.

*API testing:* I tested the functionality of the backend of an online grocery store with a modular architecture. Using postman, I checked the functionality of the shopping cart and other custom features, as well as the correctness of working with third-party delivery services, some of which work via REST, some via SOAP, and some via sql.

*Testing of mobile applications:* AndroidOS. I tested app on a given matrix of devices using android studio and a physical smartphone. As a tasting app, we used the Yandex.Metro application of the old version.

*Working with DB:* Compiled simple queries (SELECT, JOIN) to a remote server through the console. I worked with postgre and mariadb.

*Automation:* Wrote tests for web on JS with the puppeteer library. |
